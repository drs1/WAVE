# Williams ARM Virtual Emulator
######Final project for CS 237 at Williams College, ranked across last 4 years of students

We were tasked with writing a full scale ARM emulator using x86-64 architechture. Our vm ran ~25 x86-86 instructions per ARM instruction, while occupying ~700 bytes of memory, opening up a new avenue on the time-space tradeoff curve as no other team has ever been smaller and faster.
